    <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<br>

<p>EOSTree.io (“EOSTree” “We”, “Us”) is sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we collect from you and about you. EOSTree takes your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and practices to keep your personal information secure. The Privacy Policy covers EOSTree's treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect about you.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use, and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using EOSTree Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@eostree.io</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.1em;">What Information Do We Collect About Our Customers?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Traffic Data.</span> EOSTree may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, cryptocurrency address, and clickstream data (collectively "Visitor Data"). EOSTree's website (the "Site") may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").</p>

<p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cookies and Similar Technologies.</span> EOSTree and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow EOSTree to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of other plug-ins exchanging information with EOSTree ("Applications").  (The Site and Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as "Online Services" for simplicity.)  Similar technologies, such as javascripts or etags, are also used to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such login forms, will be limited.</p>
 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3rd Party Tracking.</span> The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.  We do not have access or control over these technologies.  We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
 
 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Information.</span> EOSTree requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use some of EOSTree products and services (such as Comments). Personally Identifiable Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a EOSTree employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, message boards, content submissions, requests for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by EOSTree.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, username, address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Cryptocurrency or Blockchain Data" (such as your cryptocurrency account name, account balance, and other account information that is stored on public cryptocurrency blockchain); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your zip code and sex); and (iv) other "Personal Data" (such as your date of birth, mortgage information, automobile information, marital information, and other personal identification numbers).</p>

<p>We may also receive information about our registered users or potential users from other sources.  In some instances, we may combine this data with information we already have or that we later receive from our users.  This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records and to provide better service to users.  We will only use this information for the specific reasons that it was provided to us, which may include marketing related uses. </p>

<p>If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at info@eostree.io. Certain personal information or message, or comment becomes public record when such information is stored on blockchain.</p>
 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Calls/Electronic Communications.</span> In the regular course of our business, EOSTree may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and EOSTree employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive promotion or marketing email from EOSTree, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the "Unsubscribe" link on any of the promotion or marketing emails we send. The system emails such as verification emails and notification emails will be always sent to you once you are registered or in the process of registration. </p>
 
 
 <br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.1em;">How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?</p>

<p>We use information we collect to communicate with you, process your requests, research into how to improve our services, and inform you of any change in our service or policies or your account. For example, you may receive an activation email that confirms your email address entered in the registration process, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to let you know about our new services or products.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Opting Out.</span> We may send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or account-related communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting us at info@eostree.io. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by using the "Unsubscribe" link and following the unsubscribe instructions in any electronic communication or by emailing us at info@eostree.io.</p>

<p>You may choose not to provide EOSTree with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, EOSTree cannot process from requests such as log in to your account without Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests.</span> We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site, to measure customer satisfaction.  If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes name, email address, and mailing address.</p>

<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site, and/or to send participants an email newsletter.</p>

<p>We may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.1em;">We share customer information with third parties only as follows:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Third Party Marketing.</span> Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third-party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.  In addition to sharing your data, we may also share details regarding your activities from EOSTree, as well as your Demographic, or Contact Data with these third parties.  If you later decide to opt-out from allowing EOSTree to share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their marketing purposes, you may do so by contacting us at info@eostree.io.  To the extent that EOSTree has already shared your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their marketing purposes prior to your decision to opt-out, you may opt out from future marketing by contacting the Third Parties directly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Required by Law.</span> We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Visitor Demographics.</span> Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Service Providers.</span> We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer or email service provider), help us market our products and services, or for training purposes. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Business Partners.</span>  When you purchase a product or use a service from us that is bundled with a product offered by one of our business partners, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information with those business partners so that they can provide you with the product or services included with your purchase.  These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them about you for their own marketing purposes without first asking for your permission.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Partner and Affiliate Tracking.</span> Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and other technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our site. Together with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies and other technologies to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Publicly Accessible Sections.</span> The Site includes some publicly accessible personalized areas such as EOS account owner's message and interactive comment section. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.   You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information in these areas of the site. To request removal of your personal information from our community forums, contact us at info@eostree.io.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Other Transfers.</span> We may share Personally Identifiable Information and other data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with EOSTree. If EOSTree is merged, acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with the associated transactions.</p>

<br>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Links</p>
<p>Third-Party Websites. EOSTree may maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to the Online Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to EOSTree.io and not to other websites accessible from EOSTree or that you use to access EOSTree, each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy. If you visit other websites, EOSTree is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-EOSTree websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Social Media Widgets.</span> Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the security of the information communicated through EOSTree and the security of our databases. However, no computer security system is entirely foolproof and no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to or from the Site, Applications, or through the use of our services, and you provide this information at your own risk. Also, we cannot and do not guarantee that information communicated by you to us or sent to you by us will be received or that it will not be altered before or after its transmission to us. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE SITE, APPLICATIONS, AND OUR SERVICES.

<br>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Information Processed On Behalf of Third Parties</p>
<p>In some instances, EOSTree may process Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of third-party affiliates.  EOSTree acknowledges that in these instances, you have the right to access your personal information.  Where EOSTree has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes, individuals seeking access, or seeking to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct their inquiry to the third-party affiliate (the data controller).  If requested to remove the data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
