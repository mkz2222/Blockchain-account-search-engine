    <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">Terms of Use</p>
<br>

<p>By using the EOSTree.io website (the "Site") or any EOSTree applications or application plug-ins ("Applications"), you agree to follow and be bound by these terms of use (the "Terms of Use") and agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In these Terms of Use, the words "you" and "your" refer to each user, Site visitor, or Application user, "we", "us" and "our" refer to EOSTree.io, and "Services" refers to all services provided by us.</p>
<br>
<p>It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use periodically. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If at any time you find these Terms of Use unacceptable or if you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use this Site or any Applications.</span> We may revise these Terms of Use at any time without notice to you. If you have any questions about these Terms of Use, please contact us.</p>

<p>YOU AGREE THAT BY USING THE SITE, ANY APPLICATIONS, AND THE SERVICES YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE AND YOU ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">These Terms require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</span> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Privacy Policy.</span> EOSTree respects your privacy and permits you to control the treatment of your personal information. A complete statement of EOSTree's current Privacy Policy can be found by clicking here. EOSTree's Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>

<p>When you open an account to use or access certain portions of the Site, Applications, or the Services, you must provide complete and accurate information as requested on the registration form. You will also be asked to provide a username and password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You may not use a third party's account, username or password at any time. You agree to notify EOSTree immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, user name or password. EOSTree shall not be liable for any losses you incur as a result of someone else's use of your account or password, either with or without your knowledge. You may be held liable for any losses incurred by EOSTree, our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and representatives due to someone else's use of your account or password.
In connection with the use of certain EOSTree products or services, you may be asked to provide personal information in a questionnaire, application, form or similar document or service. This information will be protected pursuant to our Privacy Policy. In addition, you grant EOSTree a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, publish and translate this personal information solely for the purpose of enabling your use of the applicable service. You may revoke this license and terminate rights held by EOSTree at any time by removing your personal information from the applicable service.
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Ownership. </span> This Site and Applications are owned and operated by EOSTree.io. All right, title and interest in and to the materials provided on this Site and Applications, including but not limited to information, documents, logos, graphics, sounds and images (the "Materials") are owned either by EOSTree or by our respective third party authors, developers or vendors ("Third Party Providers"). Except as otherwise expressly provided by EOSTree, none of the Materials may be copied, reproduced, republished, downloaded, uploaded, posted, displayed, transmitted or distributed in any way and nothing on this Site or on any Applications shall be construed to confer any license under any of EOSTree's intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. EOSTree does not sell, license, lease or otherwise provide any of the Materials other than those specifically identified as being provided by EOSTree. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by EOSTree.</p>
 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. Comments, Communications, and Other Content. </span> At various locations on the Site or through Applications, EOSTree may permit users to post ratings, reviews, comments, questions, answers, and other content (the "User Content"). Contributions to, access to and use of the User Content is subject to this paragraph and the other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>EOSTree is not the publisher or author of the User Content. EOSTree takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.</p>

<p>Although we cannot make an absolute guarantee of system security, EOSTree takes reasonable steps to maintain security. If you have reason to believe system security has been breached, contact us by email for help.
</p>

<p>If EOSTree's technical staff finds that files or processes belonging to a member pose a threat to the proper technical operation of the system or to the security of other members, EOSTree reserves the right to delete those files or to stop those processes. If the EOSTree technical staff suspects a username is being used by someone who is not authorized by the proper user, EOSTree may temporarily disable that user's access in order to preserve system security. In all such cases, EOSTree will contact the member as soon as feasible.
</p>

<p>EOSTree has the right (but not the obligation), in our sole and absolute discretion, to edit, redact, remove, re-categorize to a more appropriate location or otherwise change any User Content.
